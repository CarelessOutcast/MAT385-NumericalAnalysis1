Repo for Homework Assignments

This course is an introduction to solving mathematical problems using
numerical procedures or algorithms that can be implemented on digital
computers. We study both the mathematical theory behind these numerical
methods and their applications to solving scientific problems. The list of
topics includes numerical solutions of nonlinear equations and systems of
linear equations, numerical approximations of derivatives and definite
integrals, interpolation methods and least squares methods. The programming
language PYTHON (with its scientific computing libraries) and the computer
algebra package MAPLE will be used throughout the course. Most of the computer
procedures will be provided or developed during class.
